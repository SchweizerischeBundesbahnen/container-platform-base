# clusters: List of applications per cluster
#
# Each list element must define the following key/value pairs:
#
#   name                         (required)  Cluster name used to generate the Application name
#                                            and cluster-specific Helm value file includes
#   api                          (required)  Cluster API URL. Used to generate the Application's
#                                            'server' definition which must correspond to the URL
#                                            used for a cluster in ArgoCD
#   applications                 (optional)  List of cluster specific ArgoCD Applications that will be generated
#                                            Instead of assining applications directly to a cluster, it is possible
#                                            to use the cluster groups (see below) to assign applications to clusters.
#                                            See cluster-group-applications.yaml for details.
#   groups                       (optional)  Arbitrary list of groups the cluster belongs to. Will be used
#                                            to add group specific applications to the cluster (see cluster-group-applications.yaml)
#                                            as well as group specific value files to each application, if present.
#                                            The list is ordered from least to most specific (values/applications in more specific
#                                            groups override values/applications in less specific groups).
#                                            Group names can contain '/' to refer to value files in subdirectories.
#                                            The default is ["all"] (note: "all" is always the first element and cannot be overriden).
#   excludeApplications          (optional)  List of application names that should not be deployed
#                                            on the cluster. Mainly used to avoid deployment of
#                                            some default applications on certain clusters.
#                                            The default is not to exclude anything.
#
# Each list item in 'applications' accepts the following key/value pairs:
#
#   name                           (required)  Name of the application. If "sharedChart" is not set
#                                              (see below), this must correspond to the
#                                              directory name in the '<project>/applications/' directory of
#                                              this repository.
#   namespace                      (required)  OpenShift namespace that is managed by the Application
#   project                        (optional)  The ArgoCD project this application is assigned to.
#                                              Default is "default".
#   sharedChart                    (optional)  If set to a value, this will used as the name of the helm chart
#                                              instead of the application name. The value must correspond to a
#                                              directory name in the 'shared/charts' directory.
#                                              Default is "".
#   revision                       (optional)  Git revision/branch used for the definition of the
#                                              Application resources.
#                                              Defaults to the value of 'defaultRevision'.
#   syncPolicy                     (optional)  Argo CD has the ability to automatically sync an
#                                              application when it detects differences between the
#                                              desired manifests in Git, and the live state in the cluster.
#                                              Defaults to the value of 'defaultSyncPolicy'.
#   ignoreDifferences              (optional)  List of rules to ignore certain differences of kubernetes resources managed by
#                                              ArgoCD. Useful / necessary if some operator changes a resource
#                                              after it was deployed by ArgoCD (for example aggregated ClusterRoles).
#                                              See https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/diffing/
#                                              No ignore rules are applied by default.
#   useSecret                      (optional)  If set to 'true' it will add an additional line for a
#                                              secrets.yaml to the 'valueFiles' list generated for
#                                              the Application.
#                                              Defaults to the value of 'defaultUseSecret'.
#   useClusterSecret               (optional)  If set to 'true' it will add an additional line for a
#                                              cluster-specific secrets-<application-name>.yaml to
#                                              the 'valueFiles' list generated for the Application.
#                                              This is only required when new cluster specific secrets are
#                                              introduced since the automatic file detection works only for master branch.
#   useClusterValues               (optional)  If set to 'true' it will add an additional line for a
#                                              cluster-specific <application-name>.yaml to
#                                              the 'valueFiles' list generated for the Application.
#                                              This is only required when new cluster specific values are
#                                              introduced since the automatic file detection works only for master branch.
#   addDefaultCommonValues         (optional)  If true and the application is not in the default project,
#                                              add common.yaml value files from value groups / cluster values in the default project

#   addDefaultCommonSecrets        (optional)  If true and the application is not in the default project,

#   ignoreApplicationAddonSecret   (optional)  If set to 'true' it will ignore an existing
#                                              secrets-<application-name>.yaml file in the application values folder and
#                                              not add it to the 'valueFiles' list generated for the Application.
